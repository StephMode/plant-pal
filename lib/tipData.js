    shortBodyContent: "How to prevent and address overwatering issues.",
    bodyContent: "Overwatering is one of the most common issues faced by plant owners. When plants receive excessive water, their roots can suffocate, leading to root rot and eventual plant death. Signs of overwatering include yellowing leaves, wilting despite moist soil, and a foul odor from the soil. To avoid overwatering, ensure the pot has proper drainage holes and check the soil moisture before watering. Allow the top inch of the soil to dry out between waterings, and adjust watering frequency based on the season and plant type. Always research the specific needs of your plant to prevent this issue.",

    bodyContent: "Root rot is a common issue that occurs when plants are exposed to excessive moisture, leading to the deterioration of the root system. This condition is characterized by mushy, discolored roots and often results in wilting or dying foliage. To address root rot, it's important to take immediate action. Begin by carefully removing the plant from its wet soil to assess the extent of the damage. Trim away any rotted roots using clean, sharp scissors to prevent the spread of decay. Once you've removed the affected roots, repot the plant in fresh, well-draining soil to provide a healthier environment for recovery. Additionally, ensure that the pot has adequate drainage holes and avoid overwatering in the future to help prevent root rot from recurring.",
